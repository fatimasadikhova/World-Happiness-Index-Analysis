Data Cleaning: Duplicate, inconsistent, and empty columns were removed and standardized.
Standardization of Column Names: Columns across different years' data were harmonized for consistency.
Happiness Level Analysis: Visualizations were created using Pandas and Matplotlib, and rankings of countries were analyzed.
Visual Analysis: Graphs were created to show how happiness levels correlate with various factors.
